Reimbursement will be $5.00 per square foot for water surface area, $3.00 per lineal foot for yard measurement, and $3.00 per square foot for Deck.</li>

    </ol>

    <h4>SOIL CONDITIONS</h4>
    <ol start="4">

If the excavation of the pool is not started within 180 days from the date of the contract, or any other phase is postponed for more than thirty (30) days beyond any previous construction phase, Buyer agrees that any increase in cost of construction will increase the contract price to the extent of the additional cost of labor and materials as a result of Buyer, Buyer’s agent or home builder delaying the excavation or any other phase of construction.</li>

    <li>
        Aqua Essence Pools may assist the Buyer in obtaining financing but in no event are the financing arrangements as may be required by the Buyer a condition of this contract, for it is expressly agreed that the Buyer is solely responsible for any financing.
